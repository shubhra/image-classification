## Image Classification

Image classification using Convolutional Neural Network

In this project, I classify images from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset was preprocessed, I then train a convolutional neural network on part of the samples. The steps were -  normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, check the predictions on the remaining sample images.
